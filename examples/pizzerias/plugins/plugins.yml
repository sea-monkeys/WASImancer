  In WASImancer, WebAssembly (WASM) plugins are the building blocks that enable
  the MCP server to execute tools. 

  These plugins are compiled WebAssembly modules that:
  1. Contain one or more functions that can be called by the MCP server
  2. Run in a sandboxed environment for security
  3. Execute at near-native speed
  4. Can be written in multiple programming languages
