  In WASImancer, WebAssembly (WASM) plugins are the building blocks that enable
  the MCP server to execute tools. 

  These plugins are compiled WebAssembly modules that:


  1. Contain one or more functions that can be called by the MCP server

  2. Run in a sandboxed environment for security

  3. Execute at near-native speed

  4. Can be written in multiple programming languages
